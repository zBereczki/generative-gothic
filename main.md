title: Generative late Gothic

> “Wer sich an die Analyse der spätgotischen Bauform machen will, stößt alsbald auf eine negative Eigenschaft: die Spätgotik hat kein System; offenbar auch will sie keines haben.” - Georg Dehio

In contrast to the High Gothic, the late Gothic appears to be chaotic and disordered. The focus of this research is not on the manifestation of the building forms, but on the underlying generative principles. The preliminary statement is that if something can be generated by algorithms, it has indisputable a system, even if it is not visible on the result. The algorithms were created using [Grasshopper 3D](http://grasshopper3d.com).
